Learning to Program for the NES in 6502 Assembly

# State of the "Game"
Right now this game will read controller D-Pad inputs to move a rough-animated Mario around a semi faithfull re-creation of a mario screen in color!

Screen now scrolls to the right, but will jump back abruptly, still need to smooth out the scrolling loop 

# Tools Used
* I use Sublime Text 3 with the NESASM syntax plugin: SublimeNESASM, which can be found here: https://github.com/klaussilveira/SublimeNESASM
* I use NESASM3 Assembler which is included in this project
