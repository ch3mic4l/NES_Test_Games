# NES_Test_Games
Learning to Program for the NES in 6502 Assembly

# State of the "Game"
Right now this game will read controller D-Pad inputs to move a rough-animated Mario around a semi faithfull re-creation of a mario screen in color!

Loads a new screen when you get to the right edge, can't go back to the previous screen yet.

# Tools Used
* I use Sublime Text 3 with the NESASM syntax plugin: SublimeNESASM, which can be found here: https://github.com/klaussilveira/SublimeNESASM
* I use NESASM3 Assembler which is included in this project
* Also using the sprite set from Super Mario Bros. for testing, also included in this projects files
